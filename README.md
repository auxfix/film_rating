# film_rating

**film_rating ([movieratingsystem.rocks](http://movieratingsystem.rocks/))  - is a small movie rating web app.**
In this application you can:
  - find a movie in the open 3d party database 
  - rate the movie and save it locally(in localstorage=)) 
  - list/sort all saved films 
  - it is all =)

**here is the main stack/technologies features:**
  - it is a full CI/CD solution: if new code in the master branch built/linted/tested successfully
    it is uploading automatically to AWS S3/CloudFront
  - it is React 16 based app (hooks included)
  - typescript
  - redux/redux-saga for the state management
  - styled-components for the styling
  - react-intl for the i18n
  - it has a decent test coverage > 60%
  - (actually this app is based on that amazing [boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate-typescript)
  so i want to thank the guys who wrote it  - they did amazing work!)
